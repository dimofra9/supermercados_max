A very simple yet very effective plugin that adds a Call Now button to your website for mobile visitors (only for responsive websites).

== Description ==

###What does the plugin do?

This plugin places a Call Now button (click-to-call) to the bottom of the screen which is only visible for your mobile visitors. Because your mobile visitors are already holding their phone it will allow them to call you with one simple touch of the button. 
No more complicated copy-and-pasting or memorizing the phone number! 

###Could not be easier!
The settings are very easy: enable and enter your phone number. That's it!

If you want to add some text to your button, that's possible. Entering text is fully optional - leaving it empty will show a nice phone icon to your visitors.

You want even more control? Open up the Advanced Settings and change the default behavior.

###Only for mobile optimized themes
Usage at this point is only for responsive websites (websites optimized for display on mobile devices).

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Where can I enter my phone number? =

In the Settings section on your WordPress Dashboard you'll find a new addition: Call Now Button. Click on it to go to the plugin settings.

= I don't see the button on my website but I'm looking at it with my mobile phone. Why? =

The button will only work on websites that use a responsive theme. Responsive means that the website adapts to the size of the screen it's being viewed on. Simply put, if you need to zoom in to be able to read the text of your website on your mobile phone, the plugin will not work.

= Do I have to add a country code to my phone number? =

You don't have to but i recommend that you do to increase your options internationally.

= Do I start the number with + or 00? =

Up to you. Your phone will understand both!

= Can I change the appearance of the Call Now Button? =

Yes! You can easily change the color of the button and make it sit in the left or right corner. Or spread it out over the full bottom of the phone screen.

= I only want to show the button on a few pages. Is that possible?

Yes, you can now enter the IDs of posts and pages you wish to include or exclude.

= I need way more flexibility! Isn't there a PRO version that I can use? =

Yes, this is coming soon. We're currently looking for testers so if you want to give it a try already, please sign up at callnowbutton.com
