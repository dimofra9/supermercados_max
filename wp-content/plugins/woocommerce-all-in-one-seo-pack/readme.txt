Manage All in One SEO Pack meta details for WooCommerce Products within the Add/Edit Products view within the WordPress Administration.

== Description ==

This Plugin extends the <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/all-in-one-seo-pack/">All in One SEO Pack</a> Plugin (by <a href="http://profiles.wordpress.org/hallsofmontezuma/">Michael Torbert</a>) to display the All in One SEO Pack dialog on the Add/Edit Products screen within WooCommerce. 
Without this Plugin you cannot add/edit/manage All in One SEO Pack meta details which is why I developed this solution.

Some features:

* Title
* Description
* Keywords
* Title Attributes
* Menu Title
* Disable Product

== Usage ==
